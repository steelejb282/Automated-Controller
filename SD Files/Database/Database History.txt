-Added APokédex, a database similar to Pokédex, but alphabetized by name for ease of organization.
	It was deemed as necessary to have both an alphabetized and an ordered Pokédex database, as each 	
	organization method will have it’s uses.  However, over eighty seconds was needed to retrieve a search 
	with fifty results, and to convert it to the other system.  The addition of APokédex was designed to 
	bypass this process entirely.
-Added a neutral option to both Pokédex and APokédex.
-Alphabetized Ability, Attack, Item, and Nature.  These databases are less ordered, and so alphabetization was
	for the best.
